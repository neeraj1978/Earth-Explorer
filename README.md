# Earth-Explorer
🌍✨ Presenting — Earth Explorer
A 3D interactive globe visualization built with React, Globe.gl, and Three.js, designed to make exploring our planet feel immersive, informative, and visually stunning.

🎯 Project Overview:
Earth Explorer displays a beautifully rendered globe that users can rotate, zoom, and interact with.
It integrates real-time weather and location data, using APIs to showcase live updates directly on the globe surface.
To make the experience more realistic, I added ambient background sound and refined visual details like smooth lighting transitions, glow effects, and responsive controls.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

React.js for frontend structure

Globe.gl / Three.js for 3D rendering

Bootstrap for responsive layout

Axios for data fetching

Custom CSS animations & effects for interactivity

💡 What I learned:
Working on this project helped me dive deep into WebGL rendering, 3D scene management, and API-driven data visualization. I also learned how to optimize performance for interactive 3D components inside React apps.

🚀 It’s been a fun blend of design, data, and development — turning code into an experience!
